Common Operations:

x + y      Add
x - y      Subtract
x * y      Multiply
x / y      Divide
x // y     Floor Divide
x % y      Modulo
x ** y     Power
abs(x)     Absolute Value


import math
a = math.sqrt(x)
b = math.sin(x)
c = math.cos(x)
d = math.tan(x)
e = math.log(x)


Comparisons

The following comparison / relational operators work with numbers:

x < y      Less than
x <= y     Less than or equal
x > y      Greater than
x >= y     Greater than or equal
x == y     Equal to
x != y     Not equal to

if b >= a and b <= c:
    print('b is between a and c')

if not (b < a or b > c):
    print('b is still between a and c')
    

Converting Numbers

The type name can be used to convert values:

a = int(x)    # Convert x to integer
b = float(x)  # Convert x to float
